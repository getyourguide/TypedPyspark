# How to increment the version in Pypi

First of all you need to be authorized in pypi with an account that has access to this project.
For details see the official [packing instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

If you don't own the project reach us instead.

If you are authenticated then just run:

```sh 
python cli.py build_and_release
```
